Description: The log-rank test is performed to assess the survival outcomes between two group. 
             When there is no proper control group or obtaining such data is cumbersome, one sample
             log-rank test can be applied. This package performs one sample log-rank test as described in Finkelstein et al. (2003)<doi:10.1093/jnci/djt227> and variation of the 
             test for small sample sizes which is detailed in FD Liddell (1984)<doi:10.1136/jech.38.1.85> paper. Visualization function in the package
             generates Kaplan-Meier Curve comparing survival curve of the general population against that of the population of interest.
